# JogoDaVelha :x::o:

<p>The objective of this project is to simulate a tic-tac-toe. For this, users will inform their names (two users) and the size of the board they want to play. Each player will inform the position he will play using numbers to indicate the line and column of the board. If the player inform an already occupied position, he will have to play again. Player number one will start playing, using the symbol 'X' and the other player using the symbol 'O'. Each round, after each player has made a move, will be checked if there is a winner.</p>
